      <h3>Christian Computer Solutions is about applying todays technology to Christian needs.</h3>
      <p>The Christian church on earth (not a building but all the people) are called to gather, serve and encourage each other. (1 Peter 1:13-25)  </p>
      <p>These are all things that social networks and other modern technology can facilitate.  We believe, this can be a great way to reach many in the technologically advanced society we live in.  We are committed to developing todayâ€™s technology to facilitate Christian believers in building each other up in the faith.</p>
      <p>Join us in this mission to build up the Christian church!</p>
